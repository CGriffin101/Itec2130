        <h2>Welcome to the future of education. Your education.</h2>
        <p>
            A few years ago, Georgia Gwinnett College was home to just over 100 students. Let’s just say
            – things have changed. What was once 260 acres of rolling terrain has become the perfect
            metropolitan college campus of about 12,000 students. What’s so perfect about it? GGC adapts
            to how you do things – your learning style, your work schedule and your life. From the ground
            up, GGC was designed to help you succeed. That's game changing.
        </p>
        <h2>Founded</h2>
        <p>
            In 1994, Gwinnett County was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a four-year
            college. So Gwinnett County leaders purchased 160 acres of land and designated it specifically
            for the development of a college campus. GGC opened its doors in 2006 as the first four-year
            college founded in Georgia in more than 100 years, and the first four-year, public college
            created in the U.S. in the 21st century. Georgia Gwinnett College is a member of the University
            System of Georgia.
        </p>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Georgia Gwinnett College will be a premier 21st Century Liberal Arts College where learning
            will take place continuously in and beyond the confines of the traditional classroom. Its
            cornerstones will be innovative use of educational technology and a commitment to an
            integrated educational experience that develops the whole person. GGC will be a wellspring of
            educational innovation. It will be a dynamic learning community where faculty engagement in
            teaching and mentoring students will be the hallmark. It will be a driving force for change in
            student success. As such, it will be a model for innovative approaches to education, faculty
            engagement with students, and highly efficient student, facility, and administrative services.
        </p>
